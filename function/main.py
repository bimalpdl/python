# if __name__ is called / run as script then the output of 'print(__name__)' is '__main__' and if it is called as a module, it will output as 'module_name'

import hello  # since __name__ is called as a module, it will print the module name itself, i.e 'hello'


# we can use the if conditional clause to run the same Python file differently in different contexts.
